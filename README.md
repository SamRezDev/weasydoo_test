Welcome to my weasydoo's pre-recruiting assessment.


for ease of use, this project is divided into two parts
you can access each part via its branches  

- The "NextJS" branch
  

- The "ReactNative" branch

  How to access the site?
    
    -  git clone https://github.com/SamRezDev/weasydoo_test.git
 
    for NextJS version :
    -  git checkout NextJS
    -  npm install
    -  npm run dev

    for ReactNative version :
    -  git checkout reactnative
    -  cd weasydoo_reactnative
    -  npm install
    -  npm run start
    -  use ExpoGO on your phone, open the ExpoGO App, and scan the QR code that appears on terminal, to access the ReactNative App.
    



⭕ Some remarks ⭕: 

Due to the use of fakestoreapi, i had to make some decisions  
 - if you want to check the site/app as an admin with enhanced permissions (add,edit,remove products) you can login as user "johnd" with a password of "m38rmF$"
 - if you want to check the site as a normal visitor (with no privileges) you can login as any user that's in the database such as username: "david_r" with a password of "3478*#54"
